-class name must be the same as the program name
-public static void main (String args[])
    -main has to be public and static

-constructor has no return type (DONT PUT "VOID" EITHER)    

-when calling a constrcutor its the same as a method but you put the inputs in the same line

1.Object oriented principles: focus around classes and objects
2.Procedural: functions call function; works in a systamatic way

    Inheritence: reusing  Animal (animal->Dog,cat,fish)
    Incapsulation: hiding the details

Passing to base class: "super()"


Program:
    - set of instructions with actions and data
         ex) action: run
                data: 2miles

data type:
    - the specific type for data inputs
        ex) int String given by jdk
            When needed also possible to create own data types such as in a PersonInfo Program 
            you can create a data type called "Address"

object oriented principles:
-  programs use objects and are built around objects
    Inheritence: new objects can use the same properties as already existing ones
          ex) If you hava an Animal Program and there is Animal Class and Cat class.
            the animal class will have properties such as color or age which are also similar 
            properties of Cat class which you can then have the Cat object inherit properties from Animal
    
    Incapsualtion: hiding details  
       ex) you can see the car moving forward when hitting the accelarator
           but cant see all the actions going on inside the car
   
    Polymorphisim: multiple forms of one single object
       ex) phone is a single object but can take on the form of a camera, radio, music player

    Abstarct: --------

binary: representation of computer instructions using the numbers 0 and 1

machine language:
-set of instructions executed from computers Central Processing Unit (CPU) uses 
either binary or hexidecimal system 

compiler:
-transforms source code into a computer language

operating system: a system software that manages computer hardware and software
   Ex) OS, Linux, Windows

static vs runtime:
static:syntax erroe\r
runtime: logical error


exception: Exceptions are like errors in programs
